# Self-balancing-robot-with-matlab

This project aims to build a two-wheeled robot that works as a small, autonomous, segway. It was designed to be small to fit on a table so that people can see it more easily.


Control systems were developed using mathematical model-based design and simulating the system using Matlab and Simulink prior to its implementation on the robot. The design of the robot was done by first analyzing the dynamics of the inverted pendulum so that it had a good design to make it easier to control from the beginning. The mechanical design was done using the solidworks software.
